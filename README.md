# HitZeroGame
In this programming section you are asked to implement a solution for a game called HitZero.
HitZero is a 1-player game consisting of a sequence of integers, like this:
The rules of the game are simple. The circle on the initial square is an initial marker that can move
to other positions along the sequence. At each step in the game, you may move the marker the number
of positions indicated by the integer in the square it currently occupies. The marker may move either
left or right along the row but may not move past either end. For example, in the above array, the only
legal first move is to move the marker four squares to the right because there is no room to move four
spaces to the left.
